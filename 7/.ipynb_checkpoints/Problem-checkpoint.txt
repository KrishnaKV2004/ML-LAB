   To implement Polynomial Regression from scratch
1. Create a nx1 matrix for features.
2. Generate noise factor of nx1 dimension.
3. Generate three coefficients b0, b1, and b2 to define a quadratic equation.
4. Compute the polynomial regression model using the normal equation.
5. Plot the graph for visualization.
